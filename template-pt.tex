\subsection{Teaching Accomplishments}

\instr{
  This section should include information related to the following items:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item a brief summary of student evaluation of teaching. If available,

    evaluations (e.g., class visits, course portfolios, etc.). Note the
    expected teaching load in your department for faculty of your rank
    at the undergraduate and/or graduate levels.

  \item a portfolio of teaching materials. This should consist of a brief
    (250-300 word) teaching philosophy statement followed by materials
    that show the application of learning objectives, which may include
    sample lesson plans, syllabi, sample graded student work, and/or
    activities. It is not necessary to include all such materials, but
    the candidate should select those materials that demonstrate
    teaching excellence. Example assessment measures should also be
    included to illustrate ways that the instructor evaluated the
    efficacy of the curriculum, addressing: (a) rationale for the
    changes/development, (b) evidence of how material changed (c)
    assessment results – did the development accomplish the desired
    goals? How do you know?

  \item a brief description of innovative course development activities
    and practices.

  \item data on undergraduate student advising (level of effort,
    co-advisors, outcomes). Differentiate undergraduate research
    advising from conventional advising. For undergraduate research
    advising, list student names, research period, graduation semester,
    project title, and outcomes, such as conference presentations or
    publications.

  \item information related to workshops and short courses, number of
    attendees, and your role (e.g., organizer, lecturer, one of two
    instructors for three day course, etc.).
  \end{enumerate}

  For Research and Library faculty for whom the section is not relevant,

  promotion consideration of faculty member.''

    candidate has published his/her work,

  \item provide acceptance rates and/or impact factors (or any other
    published quality indicators or measures). If acceptance rates are
    difficult to obtain from the Internet, candidates may consider
    contacting journal editors directly,

  \item provide information related to authorship conventions in your
    field or subfield as appropriate (i.e., define how authorship order
    determined for multi-author publications). If authorship order is
    alphabetical, provide additional narrative defining role of
    applicant in publications listed, and


  \item if writing a book, text or otherwise, in your field or subfield is
    considered an important scholarly contribution.
  \end{itemize}

  Please limit the length of this narrative to no more than two pages.

Provide here a brief narrative describing evidence of external
funding activities.

Provide information on the competitiveness of the
funding sources.

Provide information on how the funds were
utilized to support students, post-doctoral, and/or
technicians.

Identify products such as number of papers, software, workshops,
book, patents, etc. that resulted from the funding generated.  This
should reference and agree with your publication record as evidence
in you CV in section 11.
}

\subsection{Student Advising}
\instr{
  If applicable, provide a brief narrative of graduate student
  advising activities. Include in this narrative commentary on: 1)
  funding activities used to support students, 2) student completion
  rates, 3) scholarly activities (e.g., publications, presentations,
  etc.) related to student work, and 4) any special items of merit or
  note that students have obtained under your mentorship.
